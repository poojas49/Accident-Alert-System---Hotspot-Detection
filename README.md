# Accident-Alert-System---Hotspot-Detection
1. Developed a unsupervised machine learning algorithm to generate accident hotspots in real time based on the readily available data from Government websites.
2. Hotspots were generated using a clustering method: DB-SCAN
3. The algorithm took into account various parameters to generate realtime hotspots like the location of the user, weather at the location, driving speed at the time of accident, road type and condition, driver's condition.
